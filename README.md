Hi! This is the code and data for my final Master's Thesis:

Controlling the Narrative: Media Discourse, Power, and the Framing of the Palestinian Genocide

If you want to know what this thesis is about, here's the abstract:

This thesis explores how mainstream media frame Palestinian suffering in the context of the Palestinian genocide, focusing on the power of language to construct meaning, legitimize actors, and shape public perception. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative text analysis with critical discourse theory, the study analyzes 5,000 headlines from a diverse range of international media outlets, from October 7th 2023 to October 7th 2024. This study aims to show how language not only reflects the reality of war, it constructs it. By tracing how power operates through discourse, this work sheds light on the broader politics of visibility, voice, and representation in international news reporting.

Keywords: Language, media discourse, text mining, Palestine, Israel, framing



The research question for my thesis was: Is there a distinction in the language used to describe Palestinians and Israelis within the context of the Gaza War?

In this repository, you'll find the data and code I used to navigate that research question, using an handful of text mining techniques, from word frequencies, bigrams, sentiment analysis and more, including the creation of a Framing Score using the OpenAI API (you'll need an API key to replicate that!).

I hope you find this work interesting and useful, enjoy!
